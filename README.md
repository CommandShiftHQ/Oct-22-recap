# Oct 22 Recap

Repo created during the lecture, building a rudimentary todo app focusing on hooks (useState & useEffect), props, and state in general.

## Installation

Clone down the repo, cd into the new directory, and install with

```
npm install
```

Run the app with

```
npm start
```

## How to use the branches

- To follow along with the lecture, checkout the `start` branch to start with the same boilerplate create-react-app code the lecture started with:

```
git switch start
```

- To see the completed repo, switch to the `completed` branch:

```
git switch completed
```
